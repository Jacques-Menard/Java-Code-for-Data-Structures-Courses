# Java-Code-for-Data-Structures-Courses
A collection of some completed assignments for some of my Data Structures courses. Might be a bit jumbled and odd due to them being structured assignments. Some code written by teachers as part of the assignments. It should be easy to tell where the teachers code ends based on comments.
